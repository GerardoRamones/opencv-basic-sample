OpenCV Basic Sample
=======

## Using Device Camera

This code shows you a very basic android project in java which opens camera through OpenCV (v3.4.5).

_OpenCV_ Manager** app is **NOT** required because all required libraries are inside the project.

Two spaces at the end of a line
produces a line break.

What does this code it do?:

  * Show a standalone implementation (No need to use OpenCV Manager app in the mobile)
  * Shows how to handle, in a basic way, the permissions to use phone camera
  * Shows a view with video stream from camera handled by OpenCV

OpenCV version (included) comes from: [link](opencvsourcecode).
